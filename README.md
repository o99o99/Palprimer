Palprimer

Primes and Palprimes Finder


This simple Python tool is for listing all primes and palprimes (primes which are also palindromic) in a certain range. 

The program will ask you the range at the start. The prime and palprime count will be shown at the bottom of each section.

There is no theoretical limit to the range, but very large ranges take a long time. For example, for a range of 0-100,000 
the program takes a few minutes to complete. For 0-100,000,000 you may well have to leave it overnight!

This is currently as fast as I can make it work. The reason I have it list every prime as it finds them is so the user can
see that it is working and not stuck in an infinite loop somewhere!

If you think anything could be improved, or if you have a way of checking for double primes or happy primes, please let me know!
