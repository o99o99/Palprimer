Palprimer

Primes and Palprimes Finder


This simple Python tool is for listing all primes and palprimes (primes which are also palindromic) in a certain range. 

You can edit the range at the top of the program. The prime and palprime count will be shown at the bottom of each section.

There is no theoretical limit to the range, but very large ranges take a long time. For example, for a range of 0-100,000 
the program takes around five minutes to complete. For 0-10,000,000 you may well have to leave it overnight!

If you think anything could be improved, or if you have a way of checking for double primes or happy primes, please let me know!
